## Problem

Imagine you need to read articles quickly. And you can use a Chrome extension, [Spreed - speed read the web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spreed-speed-read-the-web/ipikiaejjblmdopojhpejjmbedhlibno), for this purpose.
But what if articles are not written in a language does not use space for separate words like Japanese, the extension shows a lot of words on a page.
This makes the Spreed less effective.

## Solution

Your document is rewritten by this extension so that it shows up words as separate.
